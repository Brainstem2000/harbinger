Did you get a lot of data? The amount of data that traverses the airwaves every day is staggering. From smartphones, laptops, tablets and even the cars we drive, it seems that everything is\r\nbroadcasting some sort of data. We just need a way to capture all of that data and turn that data into something useful.\r\n\r\nThe Harbinger Sensor Network Project is a PASSIVE wireless sensor network for detecting devices using 802.11. HSNP is designed to capture specific bits of data that is broadcast into the air by our internet connected devices for the purpose of analyzing the historical data and producing predictive migratory path algorithms as well has trend analysis and forecasting\r\n\r\nAny idea what that means??\r\n\r\nWe want to see how the devices move through space and time thus providing us the ability to design optimal traffic flows and patterns. Better?\r\n\r\nThis project is still in its infancy but as development moves forward some key components will be added to the current code base which is currently just the sensor code.\r\n\r\n### Getting started\r\n\r\n```\r\n# git https://github.com/roobixx/harbinger.git\r\n# cd harbinger/\r\n# ./harbinger.sh\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n# git https://github.com/roobixx/harbinger.git\r\n# cd harbinger/\r\n# airmon-ng start $wlan_interface\r\n# python sensor.py\r\n```\r\n### Development Stages\r\n\r\nStage 1: Sensor Development\r\n\r\nStage 2: Centralized Data Management - April 2015\r\n\r\nStage 3: Analytic Engine with Visualization Renderings - October 2015\r\n\r\n### TODO List\r\n\r\n* modify sensor.py to record rssi levels\r\n\r\n* fix issues with random junk in captures with certain chipsets\r\n\r\n* complete MR3040 OpenWRT instructions \r\n\r\n* investigate the use of pcacpy for ease of use and flexibilty\r\n\r\n### Licensing\r\n\r\nHSPN is licensed under the GNU Public License, Version 3.0.
